# This is a shell script designed, for a user defined date and model run, download a GFS 
#   file, extract a single variable and place it into a .nc file for all forecast hours
#   in the model run for user use. This program does not accept any arguments. User
#   defined values are input during the function. This script assumes that it is located 
#   in a folder called "Thesis_Research/" and the a directory map the same as the one 
#   shown in directory_map.pdf.
#   (see https://github.com/Rarell/Thesis_Research for more detail).
